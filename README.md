# Actuarial Projects – Reynaldo Concepcion

This repository contains two actuarial data analysis projects using R, showcasing simulation, risk modeling, and statistical analysis:

## Projects

### 1. Insurance Loss Simulation & Risk Analysis

* Models aggregate insurance losses using Monte Carlo simulation.
* Calculates expected loss, standard deviation, and tail risk.
* Includes histograms and sensitivity analysis.

### 2. Exam FM: Aggregate Present Value Simulation

* Simulates aggregate present value of life insurance policies.
* Computes expected value, standard deviation, and 95th percentile.
* Includes histograms, sensitivity tables, and side-by-side scenario comparisons.

Both projects are interactive HTML reports demonstrating applied actuarial techniques and R programming skills.
